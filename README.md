# PRODIGY_ML_02
This Python code performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering based on two key features: Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal of this analysis is to identify groups (clusters) of customers with similar characteristics, which can be helpful for targeted marketing, personalized offers, or understanding customer behavior in a retail or business context. The process is broken down into several steps to ensure an effective clustering outcome.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library from a CSV file (`Mall_Customers.csv`). The relevant columns, `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`, are selected for clustering. These features represent customer income and spending behavior, which are essential for segmentation analysis. Before clustering, the data is normalized using `StandardScaler` from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module. This step ensures that both features contribute equally to the clustering process since K-Means is sensitive to the scale of the features.

2. **Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters:**
   The Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, `k`, for the K-Means algorithm. The idea is to calculate the inertia (sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centers) for different values of `k` and plot it against the number of clusters. The point where the inertia starts to level off, forming an "elbow," indicates the best choice for `k`. This method is visually effective for identifying the ideal number of clusters.

3. **K-Means Clustering:**
   Once the optimal number of clusters (`k=5`, in this case) is chosen based on the elbow plot, K-Means clustering is applied using the `KMeans` class from `sklearn.cluster`. The model assigns each customer to one of the five clusters based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The cluster labels are added to the original dataset as a new column named `Cluster`.

4. **Visualization:**
   After the clustering process, the data is visualized using `matplotlib`. A scatter plot is created where each data point is plotted with its corresponding `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`, and different clusters are color-coded for clarity. This plot allows for easy interpretation of how customers are segmented based on the two features, and it can reveal insights into customer behavior or patterns in the data.

5. **Saving the Results:**
   The final dataset, which includes the cluster labels, is saved to a new CSV file (`Mall_Customers_with_Clusters.csv`). This file can be used for further analysis or exported for use in business applications such as targeted marketing or customer analysis.

### Applications:
The clustering results can be applied to various business scenarios, such as:
- **Targeted Marketing:** Identifying high-spending customers (Cluster 1) and offering them premium services, while offering discounts to low-spending but high-income customers (Cluster 2).
- **Customer Profiling:** Understanding the characteristics of each customer group helps businesses tailor their strategies, including product offerings and communications.
- **Product Segmentation:** The clusters can also be used to recommend specific products based on customer behavior patterns.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Missing Data Handling:** If the dataset has missing values, it is important to handle them using techniques like imputation or removal of missing records.
- **Feature Selection:** Including additional features such as Age, Gender, or Region can improve the clustering result.
- **Clustering Techniques:** In case of non-spherical clusters, alternative clustering methods like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering may yield better results.
- **Cluster Evaluation:** The use of the Silhouette Score can help assess the quality of clustering and ensure the chosen `k` is optimal. 

This code offers a simple and effective solution for clustering customer data and can be adapted for different datasets and business use cases.
