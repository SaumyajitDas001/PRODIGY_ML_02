The code performs K-Means clustering on customer data based on Annual Income and Spending Score, using the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=5). It normalizes the features, applies K-Means, and visualizes the clusters on a scatter plot. The dataset is saved with the cluster labels. Improvements could include handling missing data, using additional features, or considering other clustering techniques like DBSCAN for non-spherical clusters. You can also enhance cluster selection using the Silhouette score or fine-tune hyperparameters such as n_init to improve stability and performance.
